* TL;DR

Option 1:
Use VS Code if you don't want to overthink things; it just works (well), though you might have some trouble with the initial setup.

Option 2:
Use Visual Studio (Windows) or XCode (MacOS) if you want a very complete package out-of-the-box, and want

Option 3:
Use DevC++ if you want to stick to what the course recommends.

Option 4:
Use Vim or Emacs if you cool, and are willing to suffer more in the short term.

* All Platforms
** VS Code

Pros:
- One of the most popular editors
- Multi-platform
- Can use it (well) with most languages
- Has an incredible suite of extensions

Cons:
- Can be complicated to set up inititally for C++

** Vim / Emacs

Pros:
- Efficiency
- Simplicity:
- Portability

Cons:
- Very steep learning curve
- /Need/ external tools to run programs (actually a positive if you know how to use such tools)

* MacOS
** XCode

Pros:
- Put together well
- Easy to find resources online for assistance with C++

Cons:
- Targetted more towards IOS Programming
- MacOS-specific ecosystem
- Large install size (over 10 GB)
- Overly complicated

* Windows
** Visual Studio

Pros:
- Put together well
- Easy to find resources online for assistance with C++

Cons:
- Overly complicated

** DevC++

Pros:
- This is recommended by the course

Cons:
- Clunky and buggier than your code will be
- You won't use this for long, once you start programming outside of the course

* Linux
